                        <h4>About:</h4> Democracy Demolition was developed during my 2nd year of university in a group consisting of 2 designers and 3 programmers. While working in the project I was the lead programmer and I delegated the programming tasks as well as mentored and assisted the other programmers. I worked closely with the lead designer to make sure the project goals were realistic and that we weren't overscopping with the initial design idea when it came to the technical side of the game.

                        <h4>Contribution:</h4>
                        Along side my leadership role I focused on making many of the underlying systems:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Local multiplayer capabilities</li>
                            <li>Controller input system</li>
                            <li>Character controller</li>
                            <li>Round and life systems</li>
                            <li>Ability to pause the game</li>
                            <li>Random block and trap system</li>
                            <li>An Editor tool that generated prefab blocks from sprites</li>
                        </ul>
                        As well as focusing on bug fixing and maintaining code through the project.

                        <h4>Notable issues encountered:</h4>
                        <ul class="bugList">
                            <li>
                                <h5>Controllers spawning many player instances:</h5> On the main menu the first input from two different controllers would spawn an input handler and bind that controller to player one or two, however after entering the game then going back to the main menu the next two inputs would spawn another two input handlers which would then be bound to one of the players which would then either cause a null reference exception or cause each input to be handled twice.<br>
                                <h5>Solution:</h5> When in the main menu two main checks would happen: the first check is if any input handlers exist and the number of them, if two input handlers are found any new input from different controllers would not spawn an input handler. The second check is if the main menu has been visited before and if it has then two player handlers should already exist so the ability to spawn more through inputs is disabled.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Player holding both a trap and block:</h5> During the build phase of the game the player was able to hold both a block and a trap allowing them to move and place both at the same time causing unintended behaviour this was due to the player controller's holding functionality having two boolean that checked if they were holding a block or trap and when trying to select another block the booleans were not being properly checked.
                                <br>
                                <h5>Solution:</h5> To fix this issue I created an interface class that both blocks and traps inherited from so that when doing non specialized tasks, e.g. being selected and manipulated by the player, they could be treated the same but they could still do their specialized tasks when needed, e.g. when a TNT get hit by a projectile it explodes.
                            </li>

                        <h4>About:</h4> Absorbathon was developed during my 3rd year of university in a group consisting of 4 designers and 2 programmers. In the early stages of Absorbathon all members of the group came up with idea on mechanics and design choice for what the game would become. While working on Absorbathon I worked closely with the other programmer to delegate tasks that align with our strengths so that we could both work on area of the game that we are familiar with.

                            <li>
                                <h5>Procedural level felt too linear:</h5> The first version of the procedural level generation used a path finding algorithm to generate a path between two points on a grid then would use a wander algorithm on each of the path cells with a small chance of spawning a cell. This resulted in a linear dungeon with a few short branching paths.
                                <br>
                                <h5>Solution:</h5> To make the dungeons more branching while also decreasing the chances of having dead ends, I increased the chance for the wander to spawn a cell, which would result in longer wander paths, then I used the path finding algorithm to go from the end of the wander path to the mid-point between the start of the wander path and the end of the main path. This resulted in more branching dungeons that would always loop back to the main path so that the player shouldn't get stuck in a dead end and need to back track.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Code for AI was inefficient and difficult to expand:</h5> The first iteration of the AI was using a fairly rigid system of check and functions that worked for a single type but when it came to implementing different AI type it proved to not be a very good solution.
                                <br>
                                <h5>Solution:</h5> In order to make the system more expandable and efficient I converted the AI to use a finite state machine so that complicated checks didn't need to occur to decide which state to execute but each state would hold their own conditions to transitioning to different states. This resulted in the code being easier to read and use, it was considerably easier to expand and add new states and the code was more efficient as it didn't need to do many check each time it was ran.

                        <h4>About:</h4> Looping Halls is a tech demo that has the player placed in a small corridor like environment where they are free to walk around. There is a central room with 2 branching corridors going down either corridor will cause the player to loop back to the beginning hallway. When going down the right hallway there is a 25% chance it will infinitely loop util the player turns around and goes back the way they came where they will then go back into the central room. As the player keeps moving through loops of the environment items will appear and disappear, for example on the 2nd loop a chair will appear in the central room and on the 3rd loop a section of wall on the right side of the central room will disappear revealing a 3rd corridor. The looping trick is achieved through the use of a 2nd camera and render planes, when the player touches certain triggers, it will cause the 2nd camera to start mimicking the rotation and position but in a different part of the environment. The camera's view is then projected onto a render plane so that it appears as one seamless corridor even though its two completely separate parts of the map. When the player touches the render plane they are then teleported to where the second camera was so they appear to have not move at all.

                        <h4>About:</h4> FGE is the first game engine and editor that I made during my second year of university.<br>
                        It features a working editor that consists of:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A save/load system</li>
                            <li>Profiling tools; that allows the user to see how much time profiled function calls are taking and to see a flame graph representation for each update loop.</li>
                            <li>An inspector; that allow the inspecting of game objects to see their transform and components.</li>
                            <li>An asset window; that allows importing and use of bitmap assets</li>
                            <li>A scene hierarchy window; to allow the user to see what game objects are in a scene and how they relate to one another.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The engine features:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A game object system similar to unity's; game objects have a transform and a list of components attached to it as well as a parent and list of child game objects.</li>
                            <li>A scene system where game objects are place within the scene the during the update loop all the objects in the active scene are updated.</li>
                            <li>A collision/physics system that uses axis aligned bounding boxes to detect collisions and fire event when to colliders are overlapping.</li>
                            <li>Image rendering so the user can add bitmaps to be used in the editor which can then be displayed.</li>
                            <li>A logging system so that any errors, warnings or information logs created by the engine or user can be logged to console and saved to a file.</li>
                            <li>Multithreading so there is little to no preformance hit when writing the log messages to files.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>External libraries:</h4> SDL, Dear ImGui and pugixml.
